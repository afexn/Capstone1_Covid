# Capstone1_Covid

Overview
In this project, I used interactive plots from plotly and seaborn to visualize the data in Covid_data.csv. This data set includes information about 210 nations' reactions to COVID-19's effects on the world economy.

Materials & Methods
using Linear Regression, StandardScaler, Pipeline with split functions & k-fold method. The k-fold cross validation method is used to evaluate how effectively the method performed on data.

Conclusion
Due to pandamic, the provided data cannot accurately reflect the global market's true impact. Due to a lack of equipment in some developing countries, there aren't enough cases to report. On the other hand, developed nations have sufficient testing facilities and offer more cases for both testing and showing.

Tools used
Python libraries:-

Pandas
Sklearn
